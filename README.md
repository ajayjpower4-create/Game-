# Political Election Simulator

Pick any two people — famous or invented — run them through a three-month
campaign, then either rig the map yourself or let Claude Opus call the race.

Everything in it is fiction. The results are invented for play: not a poll, not
a forecast, and not a claim about any real person or real election.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

- Game hub: <http://localhost:3000/> — lists every game
- Sports Podcast Simulator: <http://localhost:3000/podcast>
- Inspection Simulator: <http://localhost:3000/inspection>
- Election game: <http://localhost:3000/election>
- The original Swerve chatbot: <http://localhost:3000/chat>

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before starting if you want Claude to call the
election. Without a key the game falls back to its own built-in model and says
so on the results screen — every screen still works offline.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... npm start
```

`ELECTION_MODEL` overrides the model (default `claude-opus-4-6`).
`PODCAST_MODEL` overrides the podcast co-hosts' model (default `claude-sonnet-5`).

## Sports Podcast Simulator (`/podcast`)

A chat game where you're the guest on an NFL podcast. Claude plays the other three
chairs and nothing else.

**Setup.** Your on-air name, the show name, the team you're there to talk about, and
which side you're on — fan or hater. The desk is then drafted for you: three co-hosts
with their own personalities, exactly one of whom is guaranteed to ride with you. The
other two pick their own side, so you can end up 2-on-2 or buried 3-on-1. Reroll until
you like the room. You also choose whether the show is unfiltered or broadcast safe.

**The stat sheet.** Paste in whatever you've got — preseason box scores, snap counts,
depth chart, camp notes. This is the whole point: the co-hosts are forbidden from
inventing a single number. Anything they cite has to be on your sheet or out of your
mouth. If they want a stat you didn't give them, they have to ask you for it.

**The rundown.** Pick what the episode is about — record prediction, who gets cut, who
should make the 53, the QB situation, whatever — or write your own segments.

**On the air.** You open the show and it's a conversation from there. The hosts talk in
short radio lines, talk over each other, and the two against you push back every time.
Tap 📋 to pull up the stat sheet mid-argument and throw a line straight in their face —
it gets quoted above your message. The sheet filters itself: search it by any words,
and tap the chips to narrow it to a section of your paste or to a bucket the game
picked out of it — QB, run game, pass catchers, O-line, defense, special teams,
injuries, rookies, roster moves. Chips stack as an OR, search narrows whatever the
chips left, and a chip that would just repeat a section you pasted doesn't show up.

**Next week.** End the episode and you get show notes: how it went, the takes that
actually got made, and threads to pick up. Start the next episode, paste the new stat
sheet, set a new rundown — the hosts remember who said what last time.

Everything saves to the browser as you go, so a dead phone doesn't cost you the
episode. The whole thing is built for a phone first and works the same on a desktop.

## How a game runs

**1 · Draft your candidates.** Pick from the roster of famous names and the
game already knows their name recognition and where the public places them —
no description needed. Choose "someone I made up" instead and you write them
into existence: the description drives how well they poll, so words like
*veteran*, *billionaire*, *activist* or *conservative* actually move numbers.
Each candidate gets a party name and a colour, and you set election day (the
campaign window is the 90 days before it).

**2 · Three months of rallies.** Book each candidate into states across the
window. Where they go moves those states, spills over into the region, and
late rallies hit harder than early ones. "Auto-schedule 8 stops" spreads a
tour across the biggest prizes if you'd rather not click 16 times. Three
rallies each is the minimum to move on.

**3 · The message.** The line they close on, the stump speech behind every
rally, and up to five themes they hammer. Themes decide which states warm to
them — and more than three starts to blur the message.

**4 · Election day.** Two ways to finish:

- **Rig it.** Click through all 51 contests yourself (click once for candidate
  A, again for B, again to clear), then set the final vote totals. The game
  shows what your map *should* be worth — a projection with a plausible range
  for each candidate, based on real turnout baselines per state — and flags it
  when your popular-vote winner isn't your Electoral College winner.
- **Simulate it.** The whole campaign goes to Claude Opus, which calls all 51
  contests and the national popular vote and writes up what happened. State
  margins come from the local model so the returns look like returns.

**5 · The recap.** Winner, Electoral College and popular vote, the full map,
how it happened, both campaigns side by side with every rally they held, the
closest calls, the biggest blowouts and a full state-by-state table. Download
it as JSON, copy it as text, or print it.

## Saving

The game autosaves to your browser on every step and keeps the last eight
checkpoints, so a crash costs you at most the step you were in the middle of.
The Menu button reloads a checkpoint, exports a save file, imports one back, or
wipes everything.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `public/election/data.js` | States (electoral votes, turnout, cultural lean, map position), themes, the famous roster |
| `public/election/sim.js` | The local election model — scoring, vote distribution, narrative. Pure functions, shared with the server |
| `public/election/game.js` | Screen flow, save system, all rendering |
| `public/election/style.css` | Styles |
| `server.js` | Routing (game at `/`, chatbot at `/chat`) plus `POST /api/election/simulate`, which prompts Claude and validates what comes back |

The map is a grid cartogram: one tile per state placed roughly where it sits on
a US map, sized the same regardless of area, so Rhode Island is as clickable as
Texas. All 538 electoral votes are the 2024–2030 apportionment.

# Inspection Simulator

Write a sixty-page home inspection report without writing sixty paragraphs. At
`/inspection`.

You type the address, the client, the company and the year built. Everything
else in the report is a click.

## Phone or computer

The start screen asks where you are working before anything else, and the pick
changes the layout (never the report). It guesses which one you are on from the
pointer type and window width, and the Menu switches at any time.

- **Phone** — one column, 44-48px tap targets, 16px inputs so iOS doesn't zoom
  on focus, the step rail collapses to a progress bar, menus open as full-screen
  sheets, the Information tables stack label-over-value, and a floating
  *+ Add defect* button follows you down the walkthrough.
- **Computer** — the wide layout: fields side by side, the defect menu on screen
  at once.

A window narrower than 720px gets the compact layout regardless of the pick, so
choosing "computer" on a phone can't strand you in a two-column form.

## How a report gets built

**1 · Intake.** Four screens of buttons and counters: house type, floors,
basement or slab, bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, kitchens, garage bays,
attic access, cladding, roof covering, heating, water heater, service amperage,
pipe materials, weather, occupancy, shutoff locations. Those answers fill the
Information table and the standing narrative of all sixteen report sections, and
they generate the room list a defect can be attached to (three bedrooms means
Master, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3).

**2 · The walkthrough.** *Add defect* → pick the severity (Significant,
Marginal, Minor/FYI) → pick the section → pick the defect off the menu. The
report paragraph and the contractor recommendation come attached. Optionally
choose a location and type your own note; you don't have to type anything.
There are 247 defects in the menu across fourteen inspectable sections, filtered
by severity and searchable by keyword.

**3 · Anything not on the menu.** *Not on the menu…* takes a short title and a
sentence about what you saw, and Claude Sonnet writes the defect paragraph and
the recommendation in the same voice as the rest of the document — third person,
past tense, observation then consequence then recommended correction, no prices,
no guarantees.

**4 · Generate.** Claude summarizes the whole inspection into an overview and a
"what to address first" list, the findings get numbered the way an inspection
report numbers them (`10.1.2` = section ten, first item, second finding on that
item), and the document assembles: cover, table of contents, overview, summary
with a planning budget range, then every section with its Information table, its
standing narrative, and its numbered recommendations.

**5 · The score.** The game part. You are graded out of 100 on how many sections
you touched, how many findings you logged, how many carry a location, and how
many carry your own note — with the specific criticism spelled out ("2 findings
have no location attached").

Copy the report as text, download it as `.txt` or `.json`, or print it to PDF.
It autosaves to the browser on every click, and the Menu exports or imports a
save file.

Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, both AI steps fall back to local text and the
report says so on screen — every screen still works offline.
`INSPECTION_MODEL` overrides the model (default `claude-sonnet-5`).

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `public/inspection/data.js` | The intake form, the sixteen sections, their Information blocks and standing narrative |
| `public/inspection/defects.js` | The defect menu — every canned write-up and recommendation |
| `public/inspection/report.js` | Numbering, summary, cost range, scoring, plain-text rendering. Pure functions |
| `public/inspection/game.js` | Screen flow, the defect picker, the rendered document |
| `server.js` | `POST /api/inspection/defect` (writes a custom defect) and `POST /api/inspection/summarize` (writes the overview) |

Nothing in this report is real. It is a simulator for practicing and drafting,
not a substitute for an inspection by a licensed inspector.
